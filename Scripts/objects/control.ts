Program	description:    Using the Three.js JavaScript Library and TypeScript, create a web application that displays a fictitious solar system.	The	
                        solar system should have a central Sun object with at least 5 planets that orbit around it. One of the planets must have a 
                        moon that orbits around it. Include controls that allows the user to zoom the camera out to see the solar system and zoom in 
                        to view the planet with a moon.
